# FinanceTracker-App
As the name suggests, this is a simple app to keep tabs of your own finances.
As of date of writing (14th of January 2022) this app is still in its early stages of development, however basic CRUD-functionality
is existent.

## Goals
My primary goal is to create an app that can help me manage my finances without needing to fear some giant corporation spying on me.
I am not yet sure if integrations from banking or payment apps (e.g. Paypal) are possible and/or feasible.
However what I am sure about is that this app shall respect the users privacy to the utmost.

### Side notes
While the prefixes of my commits are likely self explanatory (the way every programmer claims his code to be), here is a little
explanation anyways:

MINOR: describes minor features or changes
FEAT: describes a new feature
CHORE: describes chores like updating library versions
REFACTOR: wasting client money
BONKED: when the committed code either doesn't build or when it crashes
FIX: describes fixing a BONKED commit or another bug in the code
BANDAID: describes a temporaryâ„¢ change/fix/feature

Feel free to threaten me or my cat if I ever forget to prepend one of these prefixes.
