# FinanceTracker-App
As the name suggests, this is a simple app to keep tabs of your own finances.
As of date of writing (26th of November 2021) this app is still in its early stages of development.

## Goals
My primary goal is to create an app that can help me manage my finances without needing to fear some giant corporation spying on me.
I am not yet sure if integrations from banking or payment apps (e.g. Paypal) are possible and/or feasible.
However what I am sure about is that this app shall respect the users privacy to the utmost.
