/*
 * Should there be a clear distinction between a category and an Expenditure?
 * That way there would only ever be 2 layers. One Parent layer and one child layer
 * Instead one could have multi-layers, where everything is an expenditure which can be broken up
 * into even more sub-expenditures.
 * For example:
 * Level 1: Internet-purchases
 * Level 2: Bookstore A, Delivery Service B
 * Level 3 (B): Book 1, Book 2, Book 3
